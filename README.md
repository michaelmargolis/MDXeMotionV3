# Python Motion Platform Controller Version 3
This software enables a motion simulator or other client to control movement of the Middlesex University motion platform.

### Installation
Install the software by copying all the files including the two subdirectories (client and fstlib) directories to your PC.  The software can run in any directory and no registry entries are needed. Install Python 2.7 if not already installed.
The following python modules are required to run with the example clients:
  `sys, time,  math, copy, numpy,  collections, traceback,  socket, pyqt4
The threaded client example also requires:
  `Queue, threading`

Note the roller coaster client code in coaster directory will not be publicly distributed. This software requires a licensed version of NoLimits2 and the following python modules:
  `serial, win32gui, win32api, win32con, ctypes`

### Software Overview
All activity is driven from the controller module through service calls that poll the client every 50 milliseconds. The client responds with orientation requests and/ or system commands. Orientation requests are in the form surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch, and yaw. These can be either real world values (mm and radians) or normalized values (values between -1 and 1 representing the maximum range of movement of the platform for each degree of freedom).  

Note that the system needs most of the 50ms interval between service requests to calculate and drive the output; therefore the client must return promptly from the service calls. If necessary, the client can use the threaded client example as a model to decouple client processing from the system service routine.

### Changes from previous version
This version uses pyqt instead of tkinter for the user interface

The new 'flying' platform is supported in addition to the existing chairs
